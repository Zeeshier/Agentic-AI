# Agentic AI: Tools of the Trade
# Code-Based Frameworks

For developers who want granular control over workflows, memory, and multi-agent collaboration:

## ðŸ”· LangGraph
Developed by the team behind LangChain, **LangGraph** allows you to design AI workflows as **visual graphs**.  
*Example:* Build a customer support system where one agent handles initial queries, another escalates issues, and a third schedules follow-ups â€” all connected like nodes on a flowchart.  
*Best For:* Multi-step processes that require task memory.

## ðŸ”· Microsoft AutoGen
Microsoftâ€™s **AutoGen** enables collaborative AI with multiple agents.  
*Example:* One agent writes code, another reviews it, and a third tests it. These agents can debate, self-correct, and use tools like APIs and calculators.  
*Best For:* Coding teams or research projects.

## ðŸ”· CrewAI
**CrewAI** organizes agents into specialized roles, similar to a startup team.  
*Example:* A "Researcher" fetches data, a "Writer" drafts reports, and an "Editor" polishes the final output.  
*Best For:* Streamlined collaboration without micromanagement.

## ðŸ”· LlamaIndex
Formerly known as GPT Index, **LlamaIndex** acts like a data librarian for your agents.  
*Example:* Access a 100-page PDF, SQL database, and a weather API simultaneously for informed responses.  
*Best For:* Complex retrieval and data integration.

## ðŸ”· Pydantic AI
A powerful framework for building agents with **structured and validated output**.  
*Built by:* The creators of Pydantic.  
*Best For:* Developers who want structured agent responses with ease.

## ðŸ”· OpenAI Swarm
An **experimental** framework by OpenAI focusing on lightweight collaborative agents.  
*Example:* One agent gathers data, another analyzes, and a third acts on the results.  
*Note:* Still in early stages and not production-ready.

# Visual (GUI) Frameworks

For business users or non-coders who want to build AI agents with drag-and-drop interfaces:

## ðŸ§© Rivet
Think of **Rivet** like digital LEGO for AI.  
*Example:* Drag nodes to connect ChatGPT with a CRM and auto-se
