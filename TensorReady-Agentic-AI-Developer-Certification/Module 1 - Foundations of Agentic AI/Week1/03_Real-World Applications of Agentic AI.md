## üß† System Overview

At the core is the **Orchestrator Agent** ‚Äî the brain of the system.

* It **interprets prompts**,  
* **Delegates tasks** to specialized agents (e.g., Gmail Agent, Web Search Agent), and  
* **Synthesizes** responses into a coherent final answer.

---

## üì¨ Scenario 1: "Do I have any emails from Abhy?"

1. You give the prompt to your assistant.  
2. The Orchestrator Agent detects it's a Gmail-related task.  
3. It invokes the **Gmail Agent**, which connects to your inbox.  
4. The Gmail Agent searches for emails from "Abhy".  
5. Results are returned to the Orchestrator Agent.  
6. You receive the final answer: a list of matching emails.

---

## üì∞ Scenario 2: "What's trending in NYT news today?"

1. You ask the assistant about trending news.  
2. The Orchestrator determines a web search is required.  
3. It forwards the task to the **Web Search Agent**.  
4. That agent gathers articles and identifies key trends.  
5. Summarized news is sent back to the Orchestrator.  
6. You receive a clean, final summary of trending topics.

---

## üí¨ Scenario 3: "What did my team say in Slack about the demo?"

1. You ask about team discussion in Slack.  
2. The Orchestrator recognizes it‚Äôs Slack-specific.  
3. It calls the **Slack Agent**.  
4. The Slack Agent filters and retrieves relevant messages about the demo.  
5. The Orchestrator compiles the messages into a contextual summary.  
6. You get a helpful, human-like recap.

## ‚úÖ What Makes This an *Agentic* System?

Unlike traditional chatbots, this system:

* **Understands** your prompt intelligently  
* **Selects** the correct tool or agent autonomously  
* **Executes** complex, multi-step tasks  
* **Delivers** a final answer by reasoning and delegation  

This approach enables powerful automation, deep contextual awareness, and intelligent orchestration across systems ‚Äî all with natural language.
