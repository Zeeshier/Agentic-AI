# 🧠 Building Prompts for Agentic AI Systems (TL;DR)

Learn how to design effective prompts by breaking them into **modular components** like instruction, tone, role, and constraints. We'll walk through a real-world example — improving a summary prompt step by step — to demonstrate how each element contributes to clarity, consistency, and usefulness in real-world Agentic AI systems.

## 🧰 What You’ll Get

* A breakdown of core and optional prompt components  
* A real-world example showing progressive prompt improvement  
* A modular, repeatable framework for building prompts in API-driven systems  
* Access to a [GitHub repository](#) and walkthrough video

# 🧩 Designing Prompts That Work

A prompt like “Summarize this article” might work casually, but not reliably. In **Agentic AI**, where prompts are delivered through code or APIs, your prompts must be:

* Explicit  
* Repeatable  
* Aligned with the system's goal  

This lesson moves you from intuition-based prompting to **modular, configurable prompt design** — the foundation for building **trustworthy AI systems**.

# 🧱 The Anatomy of a Prompt

Prompts consist of **modular components**. Think of these as interchangeable building blocks.

### ✅ Core Components (Usually Required)

* **Instruction** – What the AI should do  
* **Input** – The data or content it should work with  

### 🔧 Optional (But Often Critical)

* **Context** – Background that shapes the response  
* **Output Format** – Desired structure (e.g., paragraph, bullet points)  
* **Role/Persona** – Who the AI is acting as  
* **Constraints** – Limits on tone, length, style  
* **Tone/Style** – How the AI should sound  
* **Examples** – Sample outputs  
* **Goal** – The intent or purpose of the response  

📌 **Key Insight:** These components become your prompt *template*. You can tweak individual parts without rewriting the entire prompt.

# 🚧 From Components to Real Prompts

Let’s walk through a real example using the publication:

**"One Model, Five Superpowers: The Versatility of Variational Auto-Encoders"**

* GitHub repo: [Check here](#)
* Model: `gpt-4o-mini` (release date: 2024-07-18)  
* Temperature: `0`  
* Environment: API calls (stateless, no memory)

# 🧪 Prompt Walkthrough: Step-by-Step Improvements

Let’s walk through how a simple prompt evolves into a precise, purpose-driven instruction set by adding modular components one at a time.

## 🔹 Example 1: The Baseline (Instruction + Input Only)

Let’s begin with the most basic approach — just an **instruction** and the **content**.
