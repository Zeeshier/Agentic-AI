# Unit 1: Introduction to Agents

Welcome to the first unit of the 🤗 AI Agents Course! In this unit, you'll build a solid foundation in the fundamentals of AI agents. You’ll learn what an agent is, how it makes decisions, and how it uses tools to interact with its environment—all while following a simple workflow. By the end of this unit, you’ll build your first agent, **Alfred**, using smolagents, and you’ll even learn how to publish it on Hugging Face Spaces.

## What You Will Learn

### Understanding Agents
- **What is an Agent, and How Does It Work?**  
  Discover the core concept of an AI agent—a system that perceives its environment, reasons about its inputs, and acts upon them. Learn how agents are structured and what makes them autonomous.

- **Decision Making: Reasoning and Planning**  
  Understand how agents use reasoning and planning to make decisions. Learn about the internal thought processes that guide agents to set goals, evaluate options, and choose actions.

### The Role of LLMs in Agents
- **LLMs as the “Brain”**  
  See how Large Language Models (LLMs) power the intelligence of agents. LLMs process inputs, generate responses, and serve as the central "brain" that drives agent behavior.

- **Messages and Conversation Structure**  
  Explore how LLMs structure conversations using a messages system. Understand the importance of special tokens, chat templates, and maintaining context across interactions.

### Tools and Actions
- **Using External Tools**  
  Learn how agents extend their capabilities by using external tools to interact with the environment—whether it’s fetching data, making web requests, or processing files.

- **Building and Integrating Tools**  
  Get hands-on experience building your own tools and integrating them into your agent’s workflow, enabling Alfred to perform tasks beyond simple text generation.

### The Agent Workflow: Think → Act → Observe
- **Core Workflow**  
  Master the fundamental cycle of AI agents:
  1. **Think:** Process inputs and plan actions.
  2. **Act:** Execute the chosen actions using available tools.
  3. **Observe:** Monitor the results and update behavior based on feedback.

## Your First Agent: Alfred

In this unit, you will build your very first agent, **Alfred**, using the smolagents framework. Alfred will:

- Handle a simple task to demonstrate the basics of agent behavior.
- Follow the “Think → Act → Observe” workflow to process inputs, execute actions, and learn from the results.
- Serve as a practical example of how to integrate tools and manage conversation flow.

After building and testing Alfred, you’ll learn how to publish your agent on Hugging Face Spaces, allowing you to share your work with friends and colleagues.
